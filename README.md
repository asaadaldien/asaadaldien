# Hey there, It's Ahmed Taei! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and applied mathematician, the blend of both disciplines defines my work. I develop systems, algorithms, compilers, and languages for AI and numerical computing generally, so my work usually resides at the intersection of all of that.

## About Me

- ðŸ’» Currently, I'm working on [mojo](https://www.modular.com/max/mojo) ðŸ”¥ on GPUs at [Modular](https://www.modular.com/).
- ðŸ“š In my previous endeavors, I developed distributed ML training systems / algorithms, DSLs for ML kernels on custom silicon , built compilers and runtime stack from the ground up for ML accelerators. Part of this work involved contributions to opensource projects like OpenXLA/IREE Compiler, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Caffe2.
