# Hey there, It's Ahmed Taei! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a software engineer and applied mathematician, the blend of both disciplines defines my work. I develop systems, algorithms, compilers, and languages for AI and numerical computing generally, so my work usually resides at the intersection of all of that.  

## About Me  
- **Joined NVIDIA (2025â€“present)**  
- **2023â€“2024 @ Modular**: [Mojo ðŸ”¥](https://www.modular.com/max/mojo) on GPUs at [Modular](https://www.modular.com/). Part of this work was presented as an LLVM talk: [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOZWhPVvRdw).  
- ðŸ“š In my previous endeavors, I developed distributed ML training systems / algorithms, DSLs for ML kernels on custom silicon, built compilers and runtime stack from the ground up for ML accelerators. Part of this work involved contributions to open-source projects like **OpenXLA/IREE Compiler, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Caffe2**.
